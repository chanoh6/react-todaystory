          <b>3. How and Why We Use Your Personal Information.</b>
        </h6>
        <br />
        <p>
          Under data protection law, we can only use your Personal Information if we have a proper reason for doing so,
          e.g.:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>・　to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations;</li>
          <li>
            ・　for the performance of our contract with you or to take steps at your request before entering into a
            contract;
          </li>
          <li>・　for our legitimate interests or those of a third party;</li>
          <li>・　where you have given consent; or</li>
          <li>・　where permitted under applicable law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A legitimate interest is when we have a business or commercial reason to use your information, so long as this
          is not overridden by your own rights and interests.
          <br />
